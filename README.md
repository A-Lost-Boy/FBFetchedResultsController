FBFetchedResultsController
==========================

A drop-in replacement for `NSFetchedResultsController` built to work around the fact that `NSFetchedResultsController` does not work well with parent/child contexts. See `NSFetchedResultsController` for documentation.

There's not much more to it â€” the API is exactly the same as `NSFetchedResultsController`'s.
